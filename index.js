/*
    Here is a simple code to use 280 colors on web & app design. Here I focus on "RGBA" format so developer can also control opacity. 
    For example, you can invoke functions as `FlatUI().black` where opacity is by default 1 when argument is blank.
    You don't need to put floating number; just place a number range [0, 9] to control opacity.
